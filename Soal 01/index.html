        <p>We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
            But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes. <br>
            One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese, <br>
            Yet the plural of moose should never be meese. <br>
            You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice, <br>
            Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.<br></p>   
        </font>
        <font size ="3">
        <p><u>If</u> the plural of man is always called men, <br>
            Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen? <br>
            If I speak of my foot and show you my feet, <br>
            And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet? <br>
            If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth, <br>
            Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?<br></p>
        </font>
        <font size ="2">
        <p>Then one may be that, and three would be those, <br>
            Yet hat in the plural would never be hose, <br>
            And the plural of cat is cats, not cose. <br>
            We speak of a brother and also of brethren, <br>
            But though we say mother, we never say methren. <br>
            Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him, <br>
            <del><i>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</i></del><br></p>
